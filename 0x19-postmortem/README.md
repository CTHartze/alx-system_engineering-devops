![Alt Text](https://gifdb.com/images/high/programming-command-line-kermit-the-frog-t4tghmsf6oqx3c43.webp)

## Issue Summary
- **Duration:** The outage occurred on [2024-01-20] from [17:18] to [18:19] in [GMT+2].
- **Impact:** The service outage affected the availability of our primary web application, resulting in a complete unavailability for 30% of our users and degraded performance for the remaining 70%.
- **Root Cause:** The incident was caused by a misconfigured load balancer that led to an increased number of write requests, overwhelming the database servers and causing a cascading failure.

## Timeline
- **Detection:** The issue was detected at [16:17] when the on-call engineer received multiple alerts for high latency and increased error rates.
- **Actions Taken:** Upon detection, the engineering team immediately investigated the database servers, assuming a potential database issue. However, after ruling out database problems, the team escalated the incident to the infrastructure team for further investigation.
- **Misleading Paths:** Initially, the investigation focused on the database layer, leading to a delay in identifying the misconfigured load balancer as the root cause.
- **Escalation:** The incident was escalated to the infrastructure and networking teams to address the misconfigured load balancer and restore normal traffic distribution.
- **Resolution:** The incident was resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer to distribute traffic evenly and implementing additional monitoring to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- The issue was caused by a misconfigured load balancer that directed an excessive number of write requests to the database servers, leading to a performance degradation and eventual outage.
- The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer to distribute traffic evenly and implementing additional monitoring to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- To address the issue, the following tasks will be undertaken:
  - Implement automated configuration checks for load balancers to prevent misconfigurations.
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of all load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential issues.
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting to provide early detection of similar misconfigurations.

In conclusion, the incident was a result of a misconfigured load balancer that led to a service outage. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the continued reliability of our services.

This postmortem report is intended to provide transparency and insight into the incident, as well as to outline the steps taken to address the issue and prevent its recurrence. The incident postmortem report provides a detailed account of the service outage, including its impact, root cause, timeline, and corrective measures. By following the best practices for incident postmortems, we aim to foster a culture of continuous improvement and learning from such incidents.
